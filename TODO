1. User + Bot Interaction
- LangChain integration for it to keep some sort of state during a conversation
- Integration with document database or other service to get information for recipes, groceries, calorie count?

2. Message Formatting
- UI needs to display the responses much better

3. Recipe to Grocery
- Need to have ability to easily mark what you already have and then save the grocery list
  - so maybe have it generate the grocery list, and have it ask the user what it already has and then finalize and send / save?
